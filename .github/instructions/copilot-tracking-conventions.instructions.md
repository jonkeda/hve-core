# Copilot Tracking Conventions

All tracking artifacts reside under `.copilot-tracking/` at the workspace root. Every workflow follows the same three-level hierarchy: category folder, numbered instance folder, and numbered documents.

## Category Folders

Fixed PascalCase names at the first level. One folder per workflow domain:

| Category             | Folder Name          |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| RPI Tasks            | `Task/`              |
| Work Items           | `WorkItem/`          |
| Pull Requests        | `PR/`                |
| Business Requirements| `BRD/`               |
| Product Requirements | `PRD/`               |
| Architecture Decisions| `ADR/`              |
| Security Plans       | `SecurityPlan/`      |
| Memory               | `Memory/`            |
| Documentation Ops    | `DocOps/`            |
| GitHub Issues        | `GitHubIssue/`       |
| Prompt Sandbox       | `Sandbox/`           |
| Instruction Analysis | `InstructionAnalysis/`|

## Instance Folder Naming

Each instance within a category gets a numbered folder:

`{{NN}}_{{PascalCaseInstanceName}}`

* `NN` is a zero-padded sequential number (01, 02, 03, ...).
* `PascalCaseInstanceName` is a descriptive name derived from the task, branch, topic, or scope.

To create a new instance folder:

1. Scan `.copilot-tracking/{{Category}}/` for existing folders matching `[0-9][0-9]_*`.
2. Increment the highest number found (or start at 01 when empty).
3. Create `{{next_NN}}_{{Name}}/`.

## Document Numbering

Files within a subfolder or instance folder are numbered sequentially by creation order:

`{{NN}}-{{kebab-description}}.ext`

* `NN` is a zero-padded sequential number within the containing folder (01, 02, 03, ...).
* `kebab-description` is a concise, lowercase, hyphen-separated description.
* Non-markdown files (`.xml`, `.json`, `.state.json`) follow the same numbering.

Numbering rules:

* Always assign the next available number. Scan the target folder for existing `[0-9][0-9]-*` files and increment the highest number found (or start at 01 when empty).
* Numbering is scoped to each folder independently. Each instance folder and each subfolder within it starts its own sequence at 01.
* Never skip numbers or reuse a number from a deleted file.

## Document Versioning

When revising an existing document, append a letter suffix instead of creating a new number:

* v1 = `01` (no letter suffix)
* v2 = `01b`
* v3 = `01c`
* v4 = `01d`

The previous version remains as a historical record. Separate documents receive their own number.

## Instance Folder Discovery

Agents locate the active instance folder through one of these paths:

* The first agent in the workflow creates the instance folder and passes the path through handoff context.
* Prompts accept a folder parameter for the active instance.
* When resuming, agents scan the category folder for the most recent instance matching the topic.
